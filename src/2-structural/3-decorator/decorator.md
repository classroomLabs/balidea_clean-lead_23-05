# Decorator

## _Adds_ functionality to a class _without_ modifying it,

It can change the behavior without changing (Open/Close Principle observed) nor extending the class (Liskov satisfied). Could use a wrapper class or an language feature like... decorators.

The decorator has a heavy impact pattern in code, so is a good idea to use it with caution.
